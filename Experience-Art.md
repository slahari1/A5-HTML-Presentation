# Experience art in a new way

<aside class="notes"> 
Change your way of experiencing art. I will present pieces of art, but now you can engage with music and words while viewing it. This will allow the viewer to have a more holistic experience of the piece. Each slide will have 20 seconds of selected music and a few words of poetry or lyrics.

# Piece 1

<aside class="notes"> 
This first piece is a graphic design mixing photgraphy and illustration
</aside>

# Piece 2

<aside class="notes"> 
This second piece is also mixed media that uses photography and illustration
</aside>

# Piece 3

<aside class="notes">
This third piece is an illustrated poster for a film festival. The mixed perspective and parallelism and mirrored aspects take the setting of the piece out of reality.
</aside>

# Piece 4

<aside class="notes"> 
This fourth piece is an illustration with simple lines and sections of black and white that divide the image. The use of negative space creates depth.
</aside>

# Piece 5

<aside class="notes">
This fifth piece is of graphic text in complementary colors that gives off a laid back and summery vibe.
</aside>

# Piece 6

<aside class="notes"> 
This sixth piece is black and white photography. The shadows of the figures are oddly not like the distorted shadows we think of, but are very accurate to the human form. The humans themselves are actually rounded squat marks on the page, only their shadows giving the viewer and understanding of what they look like.
</aside>

# Piece 7

<aside class="notes"> 
This seventh piece is again mixed media. This time the photograph is distorted and text is also visible on the margins.
</aside>

# Piece 8

<aside class="notes"> 
This eighth piece is a gif of a seemingly endless loop of spiral patterns, drawing you into the center and back out again.
